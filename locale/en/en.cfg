[virtual-signal-description]
interface-signal-chop-trees=Mark trees for deconstruction. Set to negative amount to only chop trees until that much raw wood is in the network.
interface-signal-item-on-ground=Mark items on ground
interface-signal-catch-fish=Find all the fish. Fish are good, Fish are great
interface-signal-deconstruct-finished-miners=Deconstruct finished miners
interface-signal-landfill-the-world=Fill in all water with landfill\nSet to negative amount to keep\that much landfill in the network
interface-signal-smarter-charging=Smarter Bot Charging\nPeriodically forces some robots to find new charging spots.
interface-signal-upgrade-modules=Module Upgrader\nSwaps out lower tier modules for higher tier versions.
interface-signal-refill-turrets=Set to positive amount to fill turrets up with ammo.
interface-signal-roboport-count=Only run signals on the closest\nroboport in range.
interface-signal-roboport-channel=Roboport Channel\nWhen set only cell owners recieving the same signal and count are used.
interface-signal-bot-utilization=Percentage of bots to keep available for other actions. Range is clamped between 0-100.
interface-signal-enemy-range=Range from construction radius to check for enemies. Negative values check inwards.

[entity-name]
